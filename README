dnaPipeTE - README

v.1.1-02/29/2016

Description:

	dnaPipeTE (for De-Novo Assembly & Annotation Pipeline for Transposable Elements), is a pipeline tool designed to find, quantify and get annotation of Transposable Elements in small samples of NGS datasets.
It is very usefull to quantify the proportion of TEs in newly sequenced genomes since it do not requier genome assembly and works on small datasets.

Changelog
vers. 1.1-02-2016 (02/29/2016)

-"All in one" installation: now includes all dependencies (except Tandem Repeat Finder), it make the initial installation really easy

-Coverage and Genome Size ofptions: you can now use alternatively either -sample_size (#reads) alors or -genome_size and -genome_coverage to let the pipeline automatically sample the right amount of reads per sample; in addition it takes now into account for read size variation in the sample to adjust to the right coverage.

-dnaPipeTE can now handle fastq.gz file as input (single end only)

-You can now specify the RepeatMasker library to use (-species option; e.g. "human", "drosophila",...) according to NCBI taxa nomenclature ("All" is used by default) or you can specify your own custom fasta library (RepeatMasker format, see manual) directly with the option -RM_lib

-Annotation threshold: now you can set an annotation threshold for the estimation of repeats, corresponding to a minimum percentage hit on the query contig to retain the annotation for the whole contig (default value is to retain the best hit per query).
